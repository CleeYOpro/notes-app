## üöÄ Why I Built This
I built **JOTpop** as a **learning project to master cloud services like Render and Vercel**, while integrating **MongoDB Atlas** for a scalable backend database. This project helped me understand:
- How to deploy full-stack apps to cloud platforms
- Working with **MongoDB Atlas clusters** and managing databases in the cloud
- Backend development with **Flask and REST APIs**
- Frontend deployment on **Vercel** for rapid builds and custom domains
- Preparing for larger, more complex projects that will use similar cloud architecture

## ‚ú® Features
- Add and delete notes from any device, anywhere, anytime
- Notes are saved in MongoDB Atlas and globally accessible
- Type words like `joy`, `party`, or `cake` ‚Äî they turn into emojis automatically!
- Sleek dark glassmorphism UI, mobile-friendly

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Backend
1. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install flask flask-cors pymongo
    ```
2. **Set your MongoDB URI as an environment variable:**
    ```bash
    export MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-uri"
    ```
3. **Run the backend:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

### Frontend
1. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. **Start the frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
